# JEWEL Token

## What is the Jewel Token?

The JEWEL token is much more than your average crypto token. We’re establishing it to be the main token of value in our game, DeFi Kingdoms. You’ll use it to purchase useful items and unique NFTs such as Heroes and Kingdoms in the game, as well as various in-game things such as speeding up build times and refreshing stamina. Not only is the token used for in-game items, one-of-a-kind NFTs, but it will also be used as a common pairing against various other assets to create Jewel-LP tokens, which you can then stake in the Gardens to earn some amazing passive income. **xJEWEL, acquired by staking Jewel in the Bank, is also a governance token, so holders will have a say in the growth and evolution of the project.**

With every in-game JEWEL transaction, the transaction is portioned for the following allocations: some are deposited into the bank to reward xJEWEL holders, some are recycled back into the game into the community treasury, returning to the players as quest rewards, and some are funneled to development costs to continue to keep the development of DeFi Kingdoms strong and healthy. JEWEL is the lifeblood of our project and will allow those playing to earn actual trade-able tokens instead of playing and investing in a game with zero chance of recouping your investment. In DeFi Kingdoms, your initial investment has the potential to increase in value over time.

Early adopters are provided with the highest rewards the JEWEL token will ever see!  All rewards are greatly multiplied at the start of the project to help stimulate interest and involve loyal investors.

### JEWEL Hard Cap

The JEWEL token has a hard cap of 500,000,000 tokens.

### Pre-minting

The **10,000,000 JEWEL** tokens will be be pre-minted and distributed as follows:

* **5,000,000 JEWEL**: Allocated to fund the future development of the game. These tokens will be time-locked and release over a set schedule as features are completed.
* **2,000,000 JEWEL**: Allocated for promotion of the project, including marketing, airdrops, etc. These tokens are also time-locked to release slowly over the next few years, to ensure that there are always funds available to market the game and acquire new players and investors.
* **2,000,000 JEWEL**: Allocated for initial liquidity. These tokens will be matched with ONE tokens to form the initial liquidity pool and will not be withdrawn or sold.
* **1,000,000 JEWEL**: Allocated for bounties and hours for the founding team based on their work towards launch. Half of these will be awarded at launch, and the other half will vest over time.

### Multi-sig Wallet Treasury

**Our funds are secured in a multi-sig wallet at multisig.harmony.one.** These wallets will be controlled by 4 founding members of the project, and any transaction will require 3 out of 4 signatures to execute. This helps to protect against hacks that would target the treasuries, ensuring that there is no single point of failure. Additionally, this protects against any one member of the team having the power to do anything on their own, without the rest of the team being aware of and agreeing to it. It also gives 100% transparency, as anyone can view all of the transactions that are proposed before they are executed, as well as a history of every past transaction that was executed.

We know that people on other projects have taken advantage of their early investors, selling their native tokens shortly after launch upon the first major price spike. We seek to help put these concerns at ease with the measures listed above so our community can have more confidence in the DeFi Kingdoms project. We are in this for the long haul, and we believe there is much more money to be made by creating a successful project that many people love and play everyday, years into the future.
